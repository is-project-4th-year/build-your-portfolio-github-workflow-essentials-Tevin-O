## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

1. **Concept: GitHub Project Boards**  
   - **Expectation 👀**: Thought it was only for big teams.  
   - **Reality 😅**: A simple Kanban to track To Do → Done.  
   - **Impact 💡**: Kept me organized as I built each page of my portfolio.

2. **Concept: Feature Branching**  
   - **Expectation 👀**: Felt like extra work to branch for small changes.  
   - **Reality 😅**: Made it risk-free to experiment without breaking `main`.  
   - **Impact 💡**: I could style my navbar separately without fear of merge conflicts.

3. **Concept: Structured Commit Messages**  
   - **Expectation 👀**: Just type “fixed CSS” and move on.  
   - **Reality 😅**: The `<type>(<scope>): <description>` format clarifies history.  
   - **Impact 💡**: Reviewing my change log was a breeze when troubleshooting.

4. **Concept: Milestones & Issues**  
   - **Expectation 👀**: Felt like project management overkill.  
   - **Reality 😅**: Breaking “Landing page” into tasks (header, hero, footer) kept me focused.  
   - **Impact 💡**: No feature was forgotten, and I saw real progress on my board.
